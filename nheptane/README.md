This folder will contain versions of the n-heptane model.
Saved files should be limited to:
- input file
- chemkin annotated output
- species dictionary
- transport file
- maybe the cti?


Things that are too big and not worth it (keep these on Discovery):
- anything related to the edge
- RMG.log
- seed mechanisms
